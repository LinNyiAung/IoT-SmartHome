Components:
Battery (power source)
ACS712 Current Sensor
NodeMCU ESP8266
Wiring:
Connect the Battery to the ACS712:

Red Cable (Positive) from the battery goes to the IP+ (Current Input Positive) terminal of the ACS712 sensor.
Black Cable (Negative) from the battery goes directly to the GND pin of the NodeMCU and to the GND pin of the ACS712.
Output from ACS712 to NodeMCU:

IP- (Current Input Negative) terminal from the ACS712 connects to the Vin pin of the NodeMCU if the battery is 5V, or the 3V3 pin if the battery is 3.3V.
Connecting ACS712 Signal Pin to NodeMCU:

Connect the Vout pin of the ACS712 to one of the analog pins (such as A0) of the NodeMCU ESP8266 to read the current data.
Power the ACS712 Sensor:

VCC of the ACS712 connects to the 5V or 3.3V pin (same as what the NodeMCU is using) depending on your battery.
GND of the ACS712 connects to the common ground (battery black cable and NodeMCU GND).
