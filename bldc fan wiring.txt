Components Needed:
NodeMCU ESP8266
Relay Module (typically a 5V relay module)
Brushless DC Fan
Battery Power Supply (to power the fan)
Jumper Wires
Wiring:
Relay Module to NodeMCU:

VCC of the relay module → 3.3V or 5V on the NodeMCU.
GND of the relay module → GND on the NodeMCU.
IN1 (or IN2, depending on the relay pin) on the relay module → GPIO Pin (e.g., D1) on the NodeMCU.
Power Source (Battery) to the Fan:

Red (positive) wire of the battery → COM (Common) on the relay.
Black (negative) wire of the battery → GND of the fan.
NO (Normally Open) of the relay → Red wire of the fan.
How it Works:
The NodeMCU will control the relay. When the relay is activated (i.e., the GPIO pin goes HIGH), the relay will close the circuit, allowing the battery to power the fan.
When the relay is deactivated (GPIO pin goes LOW), the circuit opens, and the fan will turn off.

Fan's Red wire connects to NO terminal of the relay.
Fan's Black wire connects to the negative terminal of the battery.
The positive terminal of the battery connects to the COM terminal of the relay.
